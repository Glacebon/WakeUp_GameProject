Visual novel game done during Pride Game Jam 2021. The theme of the jam was "Journey".

This repository only has the .rpy- files of the project. The finished game is available on [itch.io](https://glacebon.itch.io/wake-up) and can be played on browser.

I was the solo programmer and a supporting artist of the team and this was my first time using Ren'Py engine. Most of the coding is done in the script.rpy- file. The artwork on this README is done by our team's artists Emilia R and [Neo](https://linktr.ee/neoaarni) A (top) and me (bottom).
